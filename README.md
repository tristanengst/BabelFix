# new-language-chat-helper
Intended for English speakers, this extension logs the words you look up in an online translation dictionary corresponding to your selected language, so you can later retrieve them for study.

ADDITIONALLY:

Press Ctrl+Shift+Y to view a translation to English of a selected word, and log it for further study

Press Ctrl+Shift+C to view a conjugation chart of a selected verb, conjugated however you remember it, and log it for further study

SUPPORTED LANGUAGES: Burmese, Chinese, French, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Some are broken because this is in an intermittent state of me knowing what translation sites to use)


Version 0.9.9 will likely be the last release for a while; I have college and data science to do. There are ways in which this code could be improvedâ€”but Rust and neural networks are more fun.

Version 0.9.9: Selected words persist over long time periods, selected words can be cleared, and Ctrl+Shift+C can be used to used to view verb conjugations for any conjugation of a French verb.

Version 0.9.1: Selected text is stored in the extensions popup.html in a format easy to convert to Quizlet flashcards later.

Version 0.9.0: Selected text can be translated via a Ctrl+Shift+Y in a non-intrusive popup window.
